# Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Platform! Small, well tested Pull Requests are preferred. Please ensure you provide a descriptive title for your changes and that your code is well commented. We love code that explains itself!

For feature requests or feedback, these are best handled by raising a GitHub Issue in the main Connect issue tracker.
